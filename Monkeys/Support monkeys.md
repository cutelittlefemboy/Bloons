- 040 — **Overclock** — $11,475 / **$13,500** / $14,580 / $16,200

    - _overclock_ ability
        
        - 45s cooldown
            
        - 30s duration for tier 5, 45s for tier 4, 60s otherwise
            
        - chosen tower's reload time is temporarily reduced by 40% (attacks 1.667× faster)
            
        - a hero's tier is considered to be floor(_level_ / 4), so level 20 is equivalent to tier 5
            
        - farms can be overclocked in exactly the same way: producing bananas is an "attack" whose cooldown changes according to the current round length
            
        - villages can be overclocked, even when not upgraded to 5xx: the range is increased by 25%
            
- 050 — **Ultraboost** — $61,200 / **$72,000** / $77,760 / $86,400
    
    - _nail_ attack buffed: +15p (30p)
        
    - _overclock_ ability replaced by _ultraboost_
        
        - 35s cooldown, 3 uses per round
            
        - applies _overclock_ buff as before
            
        - additionally applies a permanent 4% reload buff, which stacks additively up to 10 times
            
        - this means that after the first ultraboost, the tower has a 96% reload multiplier, after the second it is replaced by 92%, and so on down to 60% (1.667× faster)
            
        - in the case of villages, this is +2.5% to range, then 5%, etc, up to +25%r

        - ∞s lifetime
            
        - can see past obstacles
            
        - pops any bloon (not blimps) up to its pierce limit with a +1 cash modifier, but stores this cash until the pierce is entirely used up
            
        - once full, can be collected manually (100r) or automatically (5s)
            
        - can capture camos, as long as the engineer had camo detection while placing it

    - _trap_ item buffed
        
        - 10000p, 5.8s
            
        - can trap blimps other than BAD
            
        - note: unlike Obyn's _tree_, the _trap_ does not need to have more pierce than the RBE of a blimp in order to capture it
