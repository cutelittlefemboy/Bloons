# Overview

When a super monkey is upgraded to 4xx or 5xx, all non-hero towers in range — including allies' towers, if in co-op — are sacrificed to the super monkey. It gains different attacks and buffs depending on how much was spent on each tower _category_ (primary, military, magic, or support) that is sacrificed.

There are **9** sacrifice levels:

|Level|Cost|
|---|---|
|1|300|
|2|1000|
|3|2000|
|4|4000|
|5|7500|
|6|10k|
|7|15k|
|8|25k|
|9|50k|

Note that the costs must be **exceeded**, ie spending 50k exactly on primary sacrifices would give level 8 primary powers, not level 9.

The stats for each level will be written independently of the others, so there is no need to look at any earlier levels to figure out the overall effect. Attacks will be defined first and simply referred to, instead of copying the same stats multiple times.

# Sun Temple

Recall: 400 Sun Temple has a _sunblast_ attack (5d, 20p, 65r, 0.06s, normal type)

When sacrificing towers to a Sun Temple, only **three** categories count. If four categories are sacrificed then the cheapest is ignored.

A "_max temple_" is any temple with three level-9 sacrifices, usually written 1110 if support was skipped, 1101 if magic was skipped, etc.

# True Sun God

Recall: 500 True Sun God has a _sunblast_ attack (15d, 20p, 65r, 0.06s, normal type)

A True Sun God benefits from sacrifices in almost exactly the same way as a Temple, this time from **all four** categories. It keeps all attacks and buffs it had as a Temple — it simply gets a second copy of attacks. The TSG versions of an attack therefore have subtle differences to help them be visually distinct:

- **Primary**
    
    - _gold-blade_: blades are equally spaced starting from 22.5° (instead of 0°)
        
    - _gold-glaive_: arcs clockwise (instead of anticlockwise)
        
- **Military**
    
    - _gold-missile_: slightly faster projectile speed
        
    - _gold-spectre-1_: figure-infinite flight path
        
    - _gold-spectre-2_: figure-eight flight path
        
    - projectile speed and size buffs do stack, but are capped at +100%
        
- **Magic**
    
    - _arcane-blast_: slightly wider spread
        
    - _push_: none, a TSG can only have one _push_ attack (if magic is sacrificed both times, the highest level is used)
        
- **Support**
    
    - _buff_: none, but the buff from TSG sacrifices is considered distinct to the buff from temple sacrifices, and so can stack together (even if it is a separate temple)
        

A "_max true sun god_" is any TSG obtained by giving four level-9 sacrifices to a max temple, similarly written 2221, 2212, etc.

# There Can Be Only One

Monkey Knowledge has so far been omitted from these posts, but "There Can Be Only One" deserves a mention. This is triggered by upgrading a Super Monkey to 5xx, with maximum sacrifices at both tier 4 and tier 5, while the other two tier 5 Super Monkeys are also on screen (**don't** sacrifice them!). They combine into a 555 Super Monkey, commonly (but unofficially) called the "Vengeful True Sun God" or VTSG.

This has the following buffs compared to a TSG:

- _sunblast_ buffed: +25d
    
- all other attacks (including subtowers) buffed: ×2d (applied after additive buffs)
