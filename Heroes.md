# Hero mechanics

Unlike regular towers, heroes have only one upgrade path, but with 20 levels. They gain XP towards the next level at the end of every round as follows (on Beginner maps):

|Round|XP|Total|
|---|---|---|
|1|40|40|
|2|60|100|
|...|20 _n_ + 20|10 _n_2 + 30 _n_|
|20|420|4600|
|21|460|5060|
|...|40 _n_ - 380|20 _n_2 - 360 _n_ + 3800|
|50|1620|35800|
|51|1710|37510|
|...|90 _n_ - 2880|45 _n_2 - 2835 _n_ + 65050|
|80|4320|126250|
|...|||
|100|6120|231550|

For difficulties above Beginner, simply add 10% per difficulty - that's a multiplier of 1.1 if playing on an Intermediate map, 1.2 on Advanced, and 1.3 on Expert.

At any point, the next level can be bought at a rate of $1 per 1 XP, so the full amount is listed as the cost of an upgrade. Most XP will come from round XP however, so for convenience, the rounds you can expect a hero to reach a given level are also listed, for each of the four difficulties. This assumes a hero placed on round 1 with no Monkey Knowledge, so may be slightly off if this is not the case, especially at early levels/rounds.
