Welcome to _Advanced Popology_, the series of posts providing detailed information on the towers of BTD6. Hopefully everything will be clear and understandable, but explanations on the terminology and how it is presented will also be provided in an Appendix at the end of each post.

Note that the information presented is not official. It comes largely from my own tests, feedback from countless other players, and many details have been confirmed by NK — in particular from the amazingly detailed patch notes.

Despite my best efforts, it may still contain minor inaccuracies — feel free to message me with any corrections or questions, either here on Reddit or on Discord (find me in the [Ninja Kiwi](https://discord.gg/ninjakiwi) server).
